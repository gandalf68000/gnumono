This is a windows version of a self  playing monopoly built in GNU COBOL.  it uses some cool features in COBOL such as  dynamic calling of DLLs

to run the demo, you must unzip all the files to a single directory and the either double click on the Monopoy.exe (I built this over a weekend and did not notice the spelling error)

enjoy
